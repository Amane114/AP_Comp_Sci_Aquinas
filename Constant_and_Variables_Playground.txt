//: If the player scores ten points, you can update the score:
score = 10
//: Now the player scores another five points, so you can update the score again:

//: This is nice, but it would be nicer to use the existing value of `score` when calculating the new value. To add another five points, you can do this:
score = score + 5
score + 5
score
score + 3

//: But when a calculation is on the right side of an assignment, the variable stores the calculation's result and takes on a brand new value:
score = score + 5
score = score + 3
